txtai exists as well.

harmonization:
Use PostgreSQL JSONB columns to temporarily hold embedding metadata for combined queries.
Synchronize ChromaDB metadata with PostgreSQL graph nodes/edges periodically.
Build unified APIs (e.g., GET /harmonized_memory) that join PostgreSQL and ChromaDB data efficiently.
