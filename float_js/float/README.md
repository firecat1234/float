this is a branch of my float project, started on jan 28 of the year two thousand and twenty five.

it's basically just JS and an openai whatever and a button to click... if you want to send it to... ollama-js-client?

and there's a lm studio js client that... is broken on my machine.

i think i was gonna do this in react instead of vue but i copied some of my files over. apparently i can keep my config file! so fun.

:3

i would like to hook it up to a proper python-based backend but im a huge noob and i cant get it to work so i thought i'd focus on this instead of making myself cry over a fastAPI implementation that was redundant before i started

'frontend' is just a copy of the earlier one...

dont talk to me

:)
